				Astronaut Training!

*****************************************************************************

For this first assignment, I made a *small* narrative around the game. 
We are an astronaut-in-training for when they land on a new planet
and find it to be hostile. The astronaut runs around the map and can shoot
at a few different "hostile aliens" represented as the simple alien textures
on moving quads.

				How to Play

***************************************************************************


In the game folder, you'll find a folder named 'Assignment1Build.'
Navigate there and you'll find an executable 'Scenes.exe.' 
Click on that to play.

You can move your astronaut with wasd.
In order to shoot, you press the left shift key.
To exit the game, press 'Esc.'

				Enjoy!
